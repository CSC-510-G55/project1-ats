# Improvements and Feature Additions

## 1) Apply directly:
To optimize user interaction and streamline the application process, the application incorporates a direct "Apply Now" button for each job listing. This feature not only saves valuable time for users but also enhances the overall user experience by providing a seamless and efficient means to apply for jobs. Users can now initiate the application process with a single click, eliminating unnecessary steps and ensuring a smoother and more user-friendly journey through the platform.

## 2) Filtering applications: 
To enhance user convenience, especially for students managing a multitude of applications, the inclusion of filters is crucial. These filters enable users to categorize applications based on their statusâ€”such as accepted, rejected, waitlisted, wish-listed, or awaiting referrals. Additionally, the filter functionality extends to sorting applications based on location, job title, and even the company name, providing a comprehensive and efficient way to organize and navigate through the application process.

## 3) Adding Notes to Applications:
Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) traditionally cater to hiring professionals, but an innovative addition involves enabling applicants to add notes and updates to their applications. The integration of a notes feature is a powerful tool that enables users, particularly applicants, to add real-time, personalized notes and updates for each application. This dynamic feature allows candidates to actively document their application journey, noting essential dates, interactions, and any pertinent details they find important. By doing so, applicants maintain a heightened sense of organization and stay well-informed throughout the entire hiring process.
The real-time nature of this notes feature becomes a valuable asset for applicants. It empowers them to reflect on their progress and express their thoughts, motivations, and distinctive qualifications instantaneously.

## 4) Setting preferences: 
Upon logging in, the application empowers users to establish their preferences promptly. This includes selecting their experience level from a dropdown menu, specifying preferred locations, and indicating proficiency in various skills through an intuitive pop-up interface. These defined parameters play a pivotal role in generating precise predictions and aligning the user's requirements with the most suitable job opportunities.

## 5) Added Job links: 
Implemented web scraping to enhance user interaction, enabling direct access to recommended job matches. This eliminates the need for users, particularly students, to manually search for their desired positions again. The incorporation of direct job links saves significant time and streamlines the user experience.

## 6) Error Handling:
   a) Resolved the issue where only half of the countries were initially visible for location on the website. The error has been addressed, and the website now displays the entire list of countries. As a result, the website is functioning correctly, and users can access the complete list of countries for location purposes.
   b) Previously, certain pages were redirecting to undefined or error pages, a practice deemed undesirable for a high-quality application. All errors within the application have now been effectively addressed, ensuring users are seamlessly redirected to the appropriate pages.
