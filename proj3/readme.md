# Improvements and Feature Additions

## 1) Apply via job portals:
To enhance user interaction and simplify the application process, the platform includes direct links for applying for each job listing from the corresponding job board where the job was originally posted. These links enable users to seamlessly connect with the job poster and apply to the job, facilitating a direct and efficient application process. This feature not only saves users valuable time but also improves the overall user experience by eliminating unnecessary steps and ensuring a smoother journey through the platform. With a single click, users can initiate the application process, contributing to a more user-friendly and streamlined platform.

## 2) Added a new page for My Applications:
This page is a visual board that helps manage work in progress and optimize workflow. It is a useful way to organize and visualize the different stages of your job application process.

_Rejected:_
This column represents the stage where applications that have been reviewed and rejected by the prospective employers are placed.
Applicants can use this column to keep track of the positions that did not progress further in the hiring process.

_Applied:_
This column is for applications that have been submitted but are still awaiting a response from the employers.
It helps candidates to easily identify the positions they've applied for and are currently under consideration.

_Wishlist:_
The Wishlist column is for positions that the applicant is interested in but hasn't applied for yet.
This can serve as a reminder of potential job opportunities, and applicants can move them to the "Applied" column once they submit their applications.

_Waiting for Referral:_
In this column, applicants can track positions for which they are waiting for a referral or some kind of internal recommendation.
Networking and referrals are crucial in the job search process, and this column helps candidates keep track of such opportunities.

Move Cards: Applications can be represented as cards, with each card moving across the columns as the application progresses.
Visualize Progress: The board provides a visual representation of the overall status of your job applications.
Prioritize: Applicants can prioritize applications in the Wishlist column and focus on applying for those positions.
Identify Bottlenecks: If many applications are stuck in a particular column, it may indicate a bottleneck or an area that needs attention in the job search process.



## 3) Filtering applications: 
To enhance user convenience, especially for students managing a multitude of applications, the inclusion of filters is crucial. These filters enable users to categorize applications based on their statusâ€”such as accepted, rejected, waitlisted, wish-listed, or awaiting referrals. Additionally, the filter functionality extends to sorting applications based on location, job title, and even the company name, providing a comprehensive and efficient way to organize and navigate through the application process.

## 4) Adding Notes to Applications:
Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) traditionally cater to hiring professionals, but an innovative addition involves enabling applicants to add notes and updates to their applications. The integration of a notes feature is a powerful tool that enables users, particularly applicants, to add real-time, personalized notes and updates for each application. This dynamic feature allows candidates to actively document their application journey, noting essential dates, interactions, and any pertinent details they find important. By doing so, applicants maintain a heightened sense of organization and stay well-informed throughout the entire hiring process.
The real-time nature of this notes feature becomes a valuable asset for applicants. It empowers them to reflect on their progress and express their thoughts, motivations, and distinctive qualifications instantaneously.

## 5) Setting preferences: 
Upon logging in, the application empowers users to establish their preferences promptly. This includes selecting their experience level from a dropdown menu, specifying preferred locations, and indicating proficiency in various skills through an intuitive pop-up interface. These defined parameters play a pivotal role in generating precise predictions and aligning the user's requirements with the most suitable job opportunities.

## 6) Added Job links: 
Implemented web scraping to enhance user interaction, enabling direct access to recommended job matches. This eliminates the need for users, particularly students, to manually search for their desired positions again. The incorporation of direct job links saves significant time and streamlines the user experience.

## 7) Error Handling:
   a) Resolved the issue where only half of the countries were initially visible for location on the website. The error has been addressed, and the website now displays the entire list of countries. As a result, the website is functioning correctly, and users can access the complete list of countries for location purposes.
   
   b) Previously, certain pages were redirecting to undefined or error pages, a practice deemed undesirable for a high-quality application. All errors within the application have now been effectively addressed, ensuring users are seamlessly redirected to the appropriate pages.
